# dynasty-stacking

Help and credit to @EdnaBEASTmode for writing the code to pull the rosters and standings data from ffverse.
Credit to @Adeiko_FF for scraping and compiling sleeper league IDs

Used this code to run multivariate data analysis on whether stacking Quarterbacks, with Wide Receivers or Tight Ends from the same team improved season long outcomes in Dynasty leagues.

Limitations
    Rosters were pulled as of June 2022 and so would not have all been the same as they did through the 2021 season. However, given the results were far from statistical significance this is not a major issue. It would be beneficial to re-run this analysis immediately following the completion of the 2022 Fantasy Football season for more accurate results. However even this method would not account for the fact that team's rosters could have changed through the course of the 2022 season however I'm unable to come up with any clear solution to this problem.
